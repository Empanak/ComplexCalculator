# ComplexCalculator
- This is a console application (yet)
- You can realize basic operations with complex numbers in a single line, just like "(((3 + 4i) - (2i)) * (2 + 3i)) / (7i)" and it works
- This avoid bugs in situations like lack of parenthesis, invalid inputs, or syntax error in general.
- You can graphicate a complex number, this opens a window with a cartesian plane that includes the point, a vector from (0, 0) to Z, and the arc of the vector.
- You can also obtain data such as the polar form, exponential form, module and argument.
- I'm working in a nice GUI, intuitive, efficient, fast, and comfortable.
